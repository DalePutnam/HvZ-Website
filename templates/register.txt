This Sunday, February 1st at 7 pm we will be holding a small practice game to introduce the rules and have a bit of fun. Please bring your weapons and headbands/armbands. Everyone will get a chance to try both teams. It’s a good way to gain basic knowledge and skills for the week. We will be meeting in MC 2066. This is optional but advised for newer players.

It’s very important to log onto the website and READ all your emails. We will be contacting you every day with a schedule of the mini-missions happening during the day as well as the details and times for the main missions. There will also be very important details that will be disclosed over email.

Some information will be sent over twitter through @HVZAlertSystem. You can get the tweets texted to you by texting “follow @HVZAlertSystem” to the number 21212.

Another new feature is a Human Inventory that will contain items that affect all humans. These items earned through special mini-missions will make the main missions easier to complete. Zombies are also able to earn special-infected through these mini-missions.   

Don't forget to read the rules on the website.
