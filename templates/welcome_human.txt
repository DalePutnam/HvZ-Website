Welcome to the University of Waterloo Humans vs. Zombies

THE GAME STARTS AT MIDNIGHT

You are a human.

1.   Remember to wear your bandana and accept the waiver on the website, and READ THE RULES. (http://watsfic.uwaterloo.ca/hvz/documents/rules.pdf)
2.   Remember to read your emails everyday and go to drops for points and items that will make your missions easier.
3.   Zombies are worth points. If you stun a zombie, you can collect their code and enter it onto the website to trade in for fabulous prizes! These prizes include:
	5 points = supply code
	25 points = rail pass
	50 points = minor building pass
	100 points = major building pass
	250 points = officer’s badge (free life)

Good news everyone! The University of Waterloo in partnership with ZomboCorp has reached the first milestone of its MANDATORY NEURAL INTERFACE program! We have reports that those lucky students who were part of the first trials are getting used to the microchip they received 10 days ago, and because of their many benefits these students’ 
HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS levels are through the roof! These early adopters are more connected than ever via their mental wifi and direct-to-brain Z-Corp Lectures(TM), and to share these benefits with the rest of the student body we have equipped the first wave of ENHANCED STUDENTS with microchip implanters. We do hope your transition to the new vision of UWaterloo will be as smooth and swift as possible. Do not resist progress.

Remember, an interface that’s in-your-face will eventually not seem out-of-place

- Big Boss, ZEO of ZomboCorp
