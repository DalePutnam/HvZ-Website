Welcome to the University of Waterloo Humans vs Zombies!

THE GAME STARTS AT MIDNIGHT

You are a zombie.

ZomboCorp in partnership with the University of Waterloo would like to thank you for willingly accepting your part in the initial phase of its MANDATORY NEURAL INTERFACE program! We sincerely hope that by now the pain of the microchip implant has abated. In the following week you may notice a reduced need to sleep, eat, and even think. Your only desire may be to transition the remaining population into ENHANCED STUDENTS (TM). This would be good. Progress is good. The students who have not yet adopted a NEURAL INTERFACE may show resistance to your efforts to improve them, but they will be much happier after the implant. ZomboCorp wishes to remind you that sharing is indeed caring. 

Remember, an interface that’s in-your-face will eventually not seem out-of-place
